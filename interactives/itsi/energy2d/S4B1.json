    "This model has two compartments with a warm surface at the bottom. In the middle of the",
    "right-hand compartment there is a barrier.",

    "**Your task is to compare the rates of the convective heat transfer from the bottom to the top in the two compartments.**",
    "",
    "1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two thermometers.",
    "2.  When the model stops, write the temperatures measured by the thermometers and the temperature at the bottom heater.",
    "3.  Try changing the location of the barrier or adding more barriers. Click on the barrier to change size, move, or copy it.",
    "4.  Try to connect what you observe in this model to the attic in a house."
