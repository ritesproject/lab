of the CSS used in the Lab project and are distributed under the MIT license.</p>

<p>The files in the <code>src/imports/</code> directory which are copied to the <code>imports/</code> directory
when a distribution is created are all Copyright 2012 (c) by the Concord Consortium and distributed
under various open source licenses. These resources represent some of the authored content for our earlier
work on the Java versions of Molecular Workbench and Energy2D and are distributed here to aid in the
conversion of these resources to HTML5 for the Lab project.</p>

<p>Java files in <code>src/jnlp</code></p>

<p>The files in the <code>src/jnlp</code> directory are compiled Java Jar archives and are copied to <code>server/public/jnlp/</code>
when a runnable distribution is created during the build process.</p>

<p>The only files in this directory are the native Java JNI libraries for accessin g the Vernier GoIO probeware.</p>

<p>These files consist of code developed at Concord Consortium and licensed under the Lab license and the
<a href="http://www.vernier.com/downloads/software-development-kits/go-sdk/">Vernier GoIO SDK</a> distributed by
Vernier as Public Domain software (<a href="https://github.com/concord-consortium/goio_sdk">git mirror</a>).</p>

<p>Java files in the <code>java</code> directory.</p>

<p>Some of these files are also Copyright 2012 (c) by the Concord Consortium and distributed
under various open source licenses. These resources represent our earlier work to support the Java versions
of our computational simulations and probeware.</p>

<p>Some of the files are from third parties.</p>

<p>Here is a list of files in the <code>java</code> directory, their authorship and licenses:</p>

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
